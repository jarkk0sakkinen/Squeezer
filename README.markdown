## About

*I wrote this compressor to learn all I could about audio compression.
It took me several months to gather all the specs and papers I needed
and convert them into code.*

**Squeezer** is different from all the compressors I know: its knobs
are stepped to fine-tuned *preset* values, but can be changed to
*continuous* values by clicking a small orange light located next to
them.  This allows you to find nice settings fast while not preventing
optimisation of settings.

**Squeezer** adapts easily to many tastes and use cases:

- feed-forward & feed-back design
- linear, logarithmic & smooth release stage
- optical & FET detectors
- peak & RMS sensing
- hard, medium & soft knee
- flexible side-chain & parallel compression

**Squeezer** has given me a deep insight into compression.  But above
that, it has quickly become my go-to generic compressor!

*I hope that you have as much fun with this compressor as I had when I
coded it!*
